                <p>
                    Hi my name is Hannah! I’m a certified practicing speech-language pathologist with nearly four
                    years of experience helping individuals transform their communication. My ultimate goal is to
                    empower my clients to master their communication skills in a way that feels authentic, professional,
                    and confident. I believe in creating a space where growth feels natural and achievable, 
                    with a downto-earth approach that ensures you feel supported every step of the way. 
                </p>

                <h2>Why I became a coach</h2>
                <p>
                    I’ve always been an extroverted person, but my journey with communication wasn’t always
                    smooth. In high school, I struggled with public speaking anxiety and didn’t know how to truly
                    portray myself. Despite wanting to connect with others, my communication style often pushed
                    people away, leaving me feeling misunderstood and isolated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After high school, I had a realization: while I had gained confidence in speaking, my approach to
                    communication still didn’t reflect who I truly was. I recognized that I needed to change how I
                    expressed myself—not just to feel more authentic but to build meaningful relationships and succeed
                    professionally. This shift allowed me to connect better with others and even helped me land jobs
                    where my ability to communicate effectively became a strength.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fast forward to today, and that journey is at the heart of why I became a coach. I want to help others
                    embrace their authentic selves while building the confidence to communicate effectively in any
                    situation. Whether you’re looking to overcome speech challenges or refine how you connect with
                    others, I’m here to guide you toward a version of yourself that feels both empowered and true to
                    who you are. 
                </p>
